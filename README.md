# Overview

**Nodebit** is a web app for creating Bytebeat music using an interactive, node-based interface inspired by Pure Data. It allows you to connect and control nodes to explore and generate sound creatively.

Nodebit is built on top of the html5bytebeat library by Greggman, which provides the `ByteBeatNode` a [`AudioNode`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioNode) for generating and controlling audio. The app is developed using Vue 3 and is designed to offer an intuitive way to create music with minimal coding.

## Features

- Interactive Node System: Add, connect, and control various types of nodes on a canvas to build audio synthesis chains.
- Node Editing: Each node represents a specific operation or value that contributes to the sound generation. You can edit, resize, and move nodes freely.
- Export and Import: Save your work as JSON or image files and reload it at any time.
- Visualizer: Some nodes include visualizations to help understand the sound output.
- Keyboard Shortcuts: Control the flow and structure of your Bytebeat creations with convenient keyboard shortcuts.

## Nodebit Controls

- Ctrl + Click: Create a new empty node.
- Click: Select a node.
- Double Click: Edit the selected node.
- Shift + Enter: Insert a new line in the node editor.
- Enter: Evaluate the selected node.
- Delete / Backspace: Delete the selected path or node.
- 1, 2, 3, 4...: Change paths in the selected switch node.

## Node Types and Expressions

Nodebit supports a variety of node types and mathematical expressions, automatically detected when the node is evaluated:

- **Time** (t): Represents the time variable.
- **Numbers**: Supported formats include decimal, floating-point, hexadecimal, and binary (e.g., 14, .5, 0xFF, 0b1010).
- **Operators**: Standard operators like +, -, *, /, %.
- **Logic & Bitwise Operators**: Includes !, &, |, ^, >>, <<.
- **Array Operators**: Includes +[], &[], |[], etc.
- **Math Functions**: Most [JavaScript Math Methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math#static_methods) such as sin, cos, tan, sqrt, etc., are available for node calculations.
- **Switch**: Use it to select between multiple inputs.

## Special Nodes

- **Play**: Starts or pauses audio playback.
- **Stop**: Stops the audio playback and reset the t variable.
- **Reset**: Reset the t variable.
- **Visualizer** Nodes: Use visualizer or visual nodes to get visual feedback of the sound output.
- **Export**: Export your work as JSON or image.
- **Import**: Load your saved JSON or image file.
- **Mouse**: Get the current mouse (X, Y) position for interaction.
- **Help**: Displays help for a specific node.
- **Manual**: Displays this help message.
